## Summary

The objective of this project is to create an heightmap using Perlin noise and render it in 3D. A heightmap is an image where each pixel's intensity represents the height in the rendered output.

I will incorporate key features such as shading and texture mapping to enhance the visual quality. Additionally, I plan to add some biomes and water under a certain sea level (and enable the movement within the generated world using the camera )

If time permits, I also aim to simulate a day-night cycle using dynamic lighting and a skybox.

### Raylib

For this project i will use raylib because it provide abstraction around OpenGL that simplify a lot of things and allow to follow my code more easily.

## Timeline

### Week 1

- Generate an  heightmap and use it to create a 3D mesh.
- Apply basic textures and implement texture blending.
- Apply Shading

### Week 2

- Add camera mouvement
- Add biomes and water
- Add some button and selectors to modify how the terrain will be generate
